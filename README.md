BACK STORY AND GOALS
-----------------------------------------------------
THIS PROGRAM STARTED AS A WAY TO COPY AND PASTE PRESET BLOCKS OF TEXT BY JUST CLICKING A BUTTON.

IT HAS GROWN TO INCLUDE TEMPLATES AND DYNAMIC NOTE GENERATION.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL AUXILLARY COMPONENTS AVAILABLE WHICH ASSIST IN OTHER WAYS.

THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS CONSOLIDATION OF INFORMATION AND EASE OF USE WITH THE MOST
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE POSSIBLE.

WHEN ALL ASPECTS ARE USED IN CONJUCTION, THEY REDUCE CALL TIME AND MAKE THE CLAIMS PROCESS EASIER
BY ALLOWING THE ADJUSTER TO GET ACCURATE ANSWERS QUICKLY FOR POLICY AND PROCEDURE, SPENDING LESS TIME
ON NOTATION, AND SPEEDING UP THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

RECORD WHICH HAS THE CHECKBOX ACTIVATED WHEN SAVED TO ESTIMATE THE INCEPTION MILEAGE.
